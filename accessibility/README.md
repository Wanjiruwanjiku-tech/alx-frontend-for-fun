# ACCESSIBILITY

## ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

- A set of attributes that can be added to html elements to improve their accessibility for users with disabilities.

- Its main Purpose is to enhance the accessibility and usability of web content, particulaly for individuals who rely on assertive technologies such as screen readers.

- ARIA helps developers create web applications that are more accessible by providing additional semantics and interaction mechanisms.


## WCAG Conformance levels.

- __Web Content Accessibility Guidelines__ are a set of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium __(W3C)__ to ensure that web content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

- WCAG are organized into 3 levels:

1. Level A. => Minimum
2. Level AA.
3. Level AAA. => Highest

- Each level has specific criteria that must be met to achieve conformace.

### Level A

- Meeting Level A means that the web content is accessible to some users with disabilities though it may still present significant barriers to others.

-  Level A criteria address the most basic accessibility requirements, such as __providing alternative text for images, ensuring keyboard accessibility, and making sure that content is understandable and navigable__.

### Level AA

- This level of conformance represents a higher degree of accessibility than Level A.

- Meeting Level AA means that the web content is accessible to a wider range of users with disabilities.

- Level AA criteria address more advanced accessibility requirements, including __enhancing navigation for keyboard users, ensuring sufficient color contrast, providing captions for multimedia content, and making content more predictable and understandable.__

### Level AAA

- This is the highest level of accessibility conformance.

- Meeting Level AAA means that the web content is accessible to the broadest range of users with disabilities.

- Level AAA criteria include even more stringent requirements than Level AA, such as __providing sign language interpretations for multimedia content, offering additional navigation options for users with cognitive disabilities, ensuring compatibility with a wider range of assistive technologies, and minimizing distractions and interruptions.__


## The importance of Web Accessibility.

1. __Screen Readers__: Software programs that interpret and read aloud the content of a computer screen. Examples include JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver.

2. __Browser Developer Tools__: Modern web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge include built-in developer tools that can help identify accessibility issues, such as insufficient color contrast or missing alternative text for images.

3. __Accessibility Validators__: Tools like the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool and the Axe browser extension can automatically scan web pages for accessibility issues and provide recommendations for improvement.

4. __Color Contrast Checkers__: Tools such as WebAIM's Color Contrast Checker help ensure that text and background colors meet accessibility standards for readability.

5. __Keyboard Navigation Tools__: Testing web applications using keyboard navigation alone can reveal accessibility issues. Browsers themselves can be used for this purpose, as well as specialized tools like Keyboard Accessibility Checker.

6. __Accessibility APIs__: These are built into browsers and assistive technologies and allow developers to programmatically interact with accessibility features of the operating system and browser.

By leveraging these tools and adhering to best practices outlined in WCAG, developers can create web content that is accessible to all users.
